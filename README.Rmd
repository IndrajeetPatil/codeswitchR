# `codeswitchR`: Code switching in R

This `README` is an attempt to collate a list of packages that may be helpful
for teaching people how to switch between coding languages or ecosystems they
**know** and the one they wish to **learn**. 

---

This is in no way a complete list and I would appreciate if more resources are
added. Feel free to pull requests for the same. ðŸ˜Š

# Switch it up ðŸ”€

Not all of the packages mentioned below can help you *fully* learn a new
programming language, but the idea is to have a starting point that is
**familiar** and **comfortable**, which would hopefully minimize the chances
that you just give up in the early phase when the learning curve is steep.

What you know | What you would like to learn | Translator ðŸ“¦ | Examples
----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- 
`dplyr` | `data.table` | [`dtplyr`](https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/translation.html) | `r knitr::include_graphics("examples/dplyr_datatable.jpeg")`
`dplyr` | `SQL` | [`dbplyr`](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/sql.html) | `r knitr::include_graphics("examples/dplyr_sql.jpeg")`
`SQL` | `dplyr` | [`tidyquery`](https://github.com/ianmcook/tidyquery/blob/master/README.md) | `r knitr::include_graphics("examples/sql_dplyr.jpeg")`
`LaTeX` | `R`/`plotmath` | [`latex2exp`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/latex2exp/vignettes/using-latex2exp.html) | `r knitr::include_graphics("examples/latex_plotmath.jpeg")`
